  * Bug fix: Add `requirement.OpenVAS` to optional project requirements.


2016-11-21  Release 1.69.0

  * Remove the ability to remove Sonar analyses, which isn't needed anymore since the quality report software doesn't create
    Sonar analyses anymore.
  * Move the OpenVAS metrics to the environment quality section, because the OpenVAS scan primarily scans the application hosts
    and not so much the software itself. This means `requirement.OpenVAS` should be passed to the project to have the OpenVAS

    issues in their count.


2016-10-23  Release 1.65.0

  * Add a metric for the number of open security bugs from static security analysis listed in Jira. To use it,
    define a filter in Jira that lists the number of open static security analysis bugs and pass it to Jira:
    `myJira = metric_source.Jira('http://jira/', 'username', 'password', open_static_security_analysis_bug_query_id=567)`
    The `metric.OpenStaticSecurityAnalysisBugs` will be added to the project provided the project has the
    `requirement.TrackBugs`.


2016-10-18  Release 1.64.2

  * Rename `metric_source.Ymor` to `metric_source.SilkPerformer`.
  * Split the response times metric into two separate metrics: one for performance test warnings and one for
    performance test errors. Performance test warnings are performance test queries that take longer than the
    desirable response time. Performance test errors are performance test queries that take longer than the
    maximum response time.


2016-09-07  Release 1.59.0

2016-08-16  Release 1.50.0

  * Prepare for multiple implementations of the OWASP dependency report metric source. This means that adding the
    `metric_source.JenkinsOWASPDependencyReport` to the project now needs to use `metric_source.OWASPDependencyReport`
    as key:
    `OWASP_REPORT = metric_source.JenkinsOWASPDependencyReport('http://jenkins')`
    `PROJECT = Project(..., metric_sources={metric_source.OWASPDependencyReport: OWASP_REPORT})`


2016-08-15  Release 1.49.2

    measured via the regression test reports.


2016-08-11  Release 1.45.4

2016-07-11  Release 1.43.1

  * Bug fix: Give the metrics that are missing due to missing configuration the same background color as metrics
    that are missing due to sources being unreachable.


2016-07-11  Release 1.43.0

  * Distinguish between metrics that can't be measured because the source hasn't been configured and that can't be measured
    because the source isn't available or because the metric source id (e.g. url, Sonar key) isn't configured.


2016-07-09  Release 1.42.2

  * Bug fix: Don't crash when a Jenkins test report can't be reached.

2016-07-05  Release 1.40.0

  * Support for the ZAP Scan report. To use it, in the project definition, create the metric source:
    `ZAP_SCAN_REPORT = metric_source.ZAPScanReport()`
    Add the metric source to the project:
    `PROJECT = Project(..., metric_sources={metric_source.ZAPScanReport: ZAP_SCAN_REPORT})`
    And then specify for each product the security requirement and where its ZAP Scan report can be found:
    `PRODUCT = Product(requirements=[requirement.OWASP], metric_source_ids={ZAP_SCAN_REPORT: 'http://url/to/report.html'}`
    This will cause the report to contain to new metrics: `metric.HighRiskZAPScanAlertsMetric` and
    `metric.MediumRiskZAPScanAlertsMetric`.


2016-07-01  Release 1.39.0

  * Split the OWASP dependency warning metric into two metrics, one for high priority warnings and one for normal
    priority warnings.

    don't take a unit argument anymore.


2016-06-24  Release 1.35.1

  * Bug fix: Don't report 0 failing unit tests out of 0 unit tests as perfect but rather as red.


2016-06-24  Release 1.35.0

  * Lots of undocumented changes.
  * Add an OWASP dependency metric that uses the Jenkins OWASP dependency

    the size of a product be ignored in the Total LOC metric.
  * Don't report CI-jobs without builds as failing.
  * Allow for overriding the total LOC metric via the project.
  * Split the metric for measuring the number of user stories not approved or

    will determine what needs to be measured later on.
  * Introduce a abstract version control system class with `Subversion` and `Git`
    as concrete instances.
  * Use metric source id mapping to find teams in the Wiki.
  * Allow for adding a default team to a Jenkins instance. The default team is
    responsible for all jobs that have not explicitly been assigned to a team.

  * Bug fix: don't crash when a document has an invalid URL.


2014-09-03  Release 1.12.0

  * Jenkins job names can be regular expressions. The regular expressions
    should resolve to exactly one job.
  * Coverage report metric sources (JaCoCo and Emma) now take a Jenkins instance
    as first argument. This allows for using job names with regular expressions.
  * Allow for adding people (`Person` class) as team members to teams. The
    team members are listed as part of the team resources.
  * Documents can have one or more teams responsible for them.


2014-08-21  Release 1.11.1

  * The dashboard now uses column charts when displaying all versions of
    products and pie charts when displaying only the trunk versions of products.


2014-08-07  Release 1.9.1

  * Bug fix: strip revision numbers before passing them to Subversion.


2014-08-07  Release 1.9.0

  * The dashboard now uses column charts instead of pie chart so that it can
    give an overview of all product versions that are included in the quality
    report.
  * Introduce new quality attribute - dependency quality - and specify that the
    related metrics measure that quality attribute.
  * Bug fix: ignore revisions created by Maven on tags when checking for
    unmerged revisions of branches.
  * Bug fix: don't invoke the Sonar runner on products without Sonar id.
  * Remove ART performance metric. Not used anymore.


2014-07-31  Release 1.8.1

2014-07-28  Release 1.7.0

  * Add a metric for measuring regression test success, based on a Jenkins job's
    test report.


2014-07-28  Release 1.6.0

  * The name parameter for domain objects like project, team, street is now
    a keyword parameter.
  * Make a number of metrics absolute instead of relative so it is easier to set
    an upper bound on the number of cases that do not meet the criteria.
    The metrics changed are the metrics for measuring whether user stories and
    logical test cases are reviewed and approved, whether user stories have
    enough logical test cases, and whether logical test cases to be automated
    are actually automated.

    the folder names comply with a certain format.


2014-06-25  Release 1.3.0

  * Don't use the term key performance indicator (KPI) since there are way too
    many metrics to justify usage of the phrase "key". Consequently, the main
    script is renamed to quality_report.py.
  * Bug fix: Don't assume other products have Subversion paths when looking for
    dependencies.


2014-06-23  Release 1.2.11
